<h2> A little about me... </h2>

<p>
I am interested in the mathematical analysis of deep learning methods, as well as pursuing first principle approaches to modeling nature.
Following these interests I am slowly climbing out of the Dunning-Kruger Valley of Despair after swapping synthetic biological research for mathematical enlightenment.
