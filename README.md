### Portfolio style website based off of [Mozilla's Release Management Blog](https://release.mozilla.org/)


The release blog runs on Jekyll. Jekyll is a Ruby framework, therefore the Ruby language should be installed on your OS.

Jekyll is often packaged by Linux distributions so the following instructions should work in most cases:

```bash
$ sudo apt install jekyll
$ git clone the repo
$ jekyll serve
$ Go to http://localhost:4000
```
