release and quality management team is plugging more and more automation (and Machine Learning in the future) in Bugzilla, and the freeform textarea was making it more difficult (also because developers are free to do anything they want with the prefilled text, even deleting fields).
For this reason, we are moving to a typical form directly in the Bugzilla interface. [The change](https://github.com/mozilla-bteam/bmo/pull/756), developed by [Kohei](https://mozillians.org/u/kohei.yoshino) who is volunteering as a [Bugzilla UX](https://twitter.com/BugzillaUX) designer, [has been deployed yesterday](https://dylan.hardison.net/2018/10/02/happy-bmo-push-day-mojolicious-edition/) (October 2nd)
